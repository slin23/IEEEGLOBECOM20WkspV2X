            Different from the conventional driving 
			and transportation frameworks, 
			new paradigm shifts and vertical technological revolution in vehicular 
			services have emerged toward unmanned driving, automated 
			transportation, and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV). In addition to equipping 
			with advanced environmental sensing/reasoning apparatuses such as 
			high definition (HD) cameras, three-divisional (3D) panorama videos, 
			point-cloud scanners, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanners 
			to facilitate unmanned driving, the next generation driving machines 
			may also rely on mobile network infrastructures to achieve 
			ubiquitous and prompt information exchanges. For example, all 
			optical indicators (such as turn signals and brakelight on a 
			vehicle, and traffic lights on intersections) may be replaced by 
			wireless signals through device-to-device (D2D) transmissions. 
			Vehicles may also exchange their perception data or maneuver plans 
			with other vehicles, or acquire information (such as 3D scenes at 
			interactions) from remote cloud servers or road-site units (RSUs) 
			though mobile networks. To align with this trend, 3GPP has released 
			the service requirements to sustain the next generation 
			vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications in June 2018, which include 
			28 use cases to involve advanced driving, remote control, vehicle 
			platooning and extended sensors. To support all these use cases, the 
			service requirements of V2X may include extremely high throughput 
			(for 3D panorama videos or point-cloud data), low latency (maneuver 
			data for platooning), high reliability (control signals for remote 
			driving), aperiodic transmissions (for emergency trajectory 
			alignment), and high connection density. Since Aug. 2018, 3GPP has 
			launched the normative works of New Radio (NR) V2X and enhanced 
			ultra-reliable and low latency communication (eURLLC) in 3GPP 
			Release 16. To satisfy these unprecedented V2X requirements, a 
			number of new features will be introduced both in academic research 
			and industrial practice, including the new system architecture of 
			V2X (such as mobile edge computing, cloud/fog networks, 3GPP local 
			area data network, network slicing, software-defined network, etc.), 
			new radio access schemes (such as millimeter wave access, sidelink 
			transmissions, URLLC, massive connections), harmonization among 
			heterogeneous technologies (point-cloud compression, multi-view 
			video, 3D vision, environmental perception/cognition, machine 
			learning and artificial intelligent), and new designs for security.
            <br /><br />
            The objective of this workshop is to bring together 
			state-of-the-art innovations, research activities (both in academia 
			and industry), and the corresponding standardization impacts of V2X 
			for the next generation driving paradigm, so as to understand the 
			inspirations, requirements, and the promising technical options to 
			boost and enrich activities in the area of V2X. This workshop will 
			also provide a forum for exchanging ideas and networking 
			experts/researchers/engineers/students involved in the emerging area 
			of V2X.
